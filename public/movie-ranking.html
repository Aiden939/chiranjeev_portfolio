<h1>The 30 Best Movies on Netflix Right Now</h1>
<h2>This Week's Critic's Pick</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Shrek</h3>
Year: 2001<br/>
Runtime: 1h 30m<br/>
Director: Andrew Adamson, Vicky Jenson<br/>
<p>
It’s hard to believe that it’s almost been a quarter-century since the flatulent green ogre in the swamp changed family filmmaking. Think that’s an exaggeration? The referential, pop-culture playground of modern animation really starts with this massive hit, a movie that spawned three sequels and spin-offs. It’s held up well, largely thanks to a playful script and great voice work from Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy. (Note: The fourth and final film in the series is also on Netflix, but not the two in between. Don’t ask. We don’t know why.)</p>

<h3>Born on the Fourth of July</h3>

Year: 1989<br/>
Runtime: 2h 24m<br/>
Director: Oliver Stone<br/>

<p>In 1986, Oliver Stone tackled what it was like to be in country in his personal Platoon, and only three years later he followed up with a story about what it was like to come home from Vietnam in the story of Ron Kovacs. Tom Cruise does arguably the best work of his career in this powerful deconstruction of patriotism and examination of the human cost of war. It’s even better than you remember.</p>
<h3>Dark Waters</h3>

Year: 2019<br/>
Runtime: 2h 7m<br/>
Director: Todd Haynes<br/>

<p>Dark Waters will make you angry. Mark Ruffalo stars in this true story from director Todd Haynes, known for more formally ambitious stuff but able to nail the old-fashioned outrage needed for this one. Based on a New York Times article, the movie details an investigation into the DuPont corporation’s poisoning of a small town with chemicals in the drinking water. Ruffalo is great, and so are Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, and especially the great Bill Camp</p>
